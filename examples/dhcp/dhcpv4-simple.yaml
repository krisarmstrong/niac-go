  # Client devices that will request DHCP
  - name: client-01
    mac: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01"
    # No IP - will get from DHCP

  - name: client-02
    mac: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02"
    # No IP - will get from DHCP

# DHCPv4 Notes:
# - Server needs a static IP on the network
# - Clients without IP will request DHCP
# - Pool range should be within the network subnet
# - Gateway typically the router/server IP
# - DNS servers can be public (8.8.8.8) or private
# - Lease time in seconds (86400 = 24 hours, 3600 = 1 hour)
