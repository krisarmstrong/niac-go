# Dual-Stack Network Notes:
# - Most common modern configuration
# - Provides IPv4 for legacy compatibility
# - Provides IPv6 for future-proofing
# - Devices can communicate over either protocol
# - Use 'ips' array to specify multiple addresses
# - Mix IPv4 and IPv6 freely in the array
# - Protocols will automatically use appropriate addresses
