  # Workstation with IPv6

# IPv6-Only Network Notes:
# - Modern network setup
# - Uses 'ips' array for multiple addresses
# - Link-local addresses (fe80::/10) for local segment
# - Global unicast (2000::/3) for internet routing
# - Unique local addresses (fc00::/7) for private networks
# - No IPv4 fallback - pure IPv6 environment
