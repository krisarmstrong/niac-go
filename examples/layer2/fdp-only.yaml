# FDP-Only Configuration Example
# Demonstrates Foundry Discovery Protocol
# Use this for Foundry/Brocade/Ruckus ICX environments

# FDP Protocol Notes:
# - Foundry/Brocade proprietary protocol (now Ruckus after acquisitions)
# - Similar to CDP but for Foundry/Brocade equipment
# - Uses multicast MAC 01:E0:52:CC:CC:CC
# - advertise_interval: How often to send FDP frames (typically 60s)
# - holdtime: How long neighbors should keep the information (typically 180s)
# - Port ID format varies by model:
#   * Older: "1/1" (slot/port)
#   * Newer ICX: "1/1/1" (stack-unit/module/port)
