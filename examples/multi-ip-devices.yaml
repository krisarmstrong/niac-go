# Multi-IP Device Configuration Example (v1.5.0 Feature 3)
# Demonstrates devices with multiple IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

devices:
  # Traditional single-IP device (backward compatible syntax)
  - name: router1
    mac: "00:11:22:33:44:01"
    ip: "192.168.1.1"

  # Multi-homed server with multiple IPv4 addresses
  # Useful for servers with interfaces on multiple subnets
  - name: multi-homed-server
    mac: "00:11:22:33:44:02"
    ips:
      - "192.168.1.10"   # Management network
      - "192.168.2.10"   # Production network
      - "10.0.0.10"      # Storage network

  # Dual-stack server with both IPv4 and IPv6
  # Modern servers typically support both protocols
  - name: dual-stack-server
    mac: "00:11:22:33:44:03"
    ips:
      - "192.168.1.20"                  # IPv4 address
      - "fe80::211:22ff:fe33:4403"     # Link-local IPv6
      - "2001:db8::20"                  # Global IPv6

  # IPv6-only server (future-proof configuration)
  - name: ipv6-only-server
    mac: "00:11:22:33:44:04"
    ips:
      - "fe80::211:22ff:fe33:4404"     # Link-local
      - "2001:db8::100"                 # Global unicast
      - "fd00::100"                     # Unique local

  # Load balancer with virtual IPs
  - name: load-balancer
    mac: "00:11:22:33:44:05"
    ips:
      - "192.168.1.30"   # Primary IP
      - "192.168.1.31"   # Virtual IP 1
      - "192.168.1.32"   # Virtual IP 2
      - "192.168.1.33"   # Virtual IP 3

# Notes:
# - Devices can have any combination of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
# - All IP addresses are registered in the device table
# - Protocol handlers can respond from any configured IP
# - Use 'ip:' for single address (backward compatible)
# - Use 'ips:' array for multiple addresses (new in v1.5.0)
